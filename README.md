# An-Endless-Night
Created : November 2016

This was the semester-long project for my first software development course. It served as an illustration of the software development lifecycle, as executed by the waterfall methodology. There are still a few issues and bugs currently in the project, which are addressed in the Issues section.

This project was an invaluable learning opportunity for the full development cycle, as well as my first experience developing a project with a team rather than individually.
