## About An Endless Night
This was the semester-long project for my first software engineering course. It served as an illustration of the software development lifecycle, as executed by the waterfall methodology. The waterfall methodology was useful for illustarting the individual steps of the software development lifecycle, and fit well into the flow of a course due to the linear progression. However, it was more useful in helping to illustrate why it is no longer widely used and why most industry leaders have moved to Agile or other similar methodologies. There are still a few issues, bugs and unimplemented functional requirements currently in the project, which are addressed in the Issues section.

This project was an invaluable learning opportunity for the full development cycle, as well as my first experience developing a project with a team rather than individually.
